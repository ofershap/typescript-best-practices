description: Audit the current codebase for TypeScript best practice violations

Scan the current project for TypeScript anti-patterns and best practice violations.

For each issue found:
1. Show the file and line
2. Explain what's wrong
3. Show the correct pattern
4. Rate severity: critical / warning / info

Use the typescript-best-practices skill for reference on current best practices.
