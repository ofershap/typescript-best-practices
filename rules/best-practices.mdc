- Always enable strict mode in tsconfig.json  - never set strict: false
- Use satisfies operator for type checking without widening  - never use "as" for type assertions unless absolutely necessary
- Prefer discriminated unions with a "type" or "kind" field over optional properties
- Use unknown instead of any for values of uncertain type
- Use import type for type-only imports
- Add const assertions when literal types are needed (as const on arrays/objects)
- Use exhaustive switch with never in default branch when handling union types
- Prefer type predicates (x is T) over type assertions for runtime type checks
- When noUncheckedIndexedAccess is enabled, always check for undefined before using indexed access results
